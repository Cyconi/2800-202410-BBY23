## Project Description
We are BBY – 23, Radmir, Nathan, Jeremy, Jonathan, and Maksim. As technology advances, we become more isolated, lose vital social skills, and feel lonelier. That’s where Better U comes in—a self-improvement app designed to help you become the person you want to be, the better version of you! Our app includes an interpersonal skills trainer to enhance your social interactions, a habit tracker and hobby finder to develop new interests, and a study section to optimize learning.

## AI services and products
Maksim Sadreev:
I utilized AI to enhance various aspects of the codebase.
Specifically, AI was employed to:
1. ChatGPT generated six unique scenarios designed to help users practice and improve their social interaction skills.
2. ChatGPT also created six corresponding JSON files for these scenarios, ensuring that the game can easily parse and utilize the content.
3. ChatGPT assisted in creating several functions, such as:
   - toggleCard function in select_scenario.ejs, studyGuide.ejs, and studyPage.ejs
   - showQuestion function in game.js
4. ChatGPT helped in understanding how to read each JSON file synchronously and parse the JSON content of each file in interpersonal.js.
Nathan Hilde:
I used Copilot and ChatGPT to create base templates for EJS files.
