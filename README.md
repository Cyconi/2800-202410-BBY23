## Project Description
We are BBY – 23, Radmir, Nathan, Jeremy, Jonathan, and Maksim. As technology advances, we become more isolated, lose vital social skills, and feel lonelier. That’s where Better U comes in—a self-improvement app designed to help you become the person you want to be, the better version of you! Our app includes an interpersonal skills trainer to enhance your social interactions, a habit tracker and hobby finder to develop new interests, and a study section to optimize learning.
